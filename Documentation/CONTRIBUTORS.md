This is a list of contributors to Dijkstra's Dynamic Ducks's codebase.  We maintain
this list because we often work in pairs and groups, but Github only knows about the
person who actually does the commits. This gives credit to both members
of the pair and groups.

If you contribute, please add yourself to the bottom of the list and
submit the change with your pull request.
