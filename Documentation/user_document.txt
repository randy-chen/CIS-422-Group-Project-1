How to:

After compiling a CSV file with all of your student's names, email, and available times, run our program.

Here is an example of what the input CSV data should look like:

Timestamp,Full Name,UOregon Email,Sunday,Monday,Tuesday,Wednesday,Thursday,Friday,Saturday
2017/04/11 1:13:23 PM MDT,Puddles McPoodle,puddles@uoregon.edu,11am;10am;4pm;5pm;12pm;3pm,,,6pm;7pm;9am;5pm,2pm;5pm;4pm;11am;9am;3pm;8pm;8am;10am;1pm,,10am;3pm;2pm;8am;11am

When our program starts running, select your CSV file on the left side of the screen and click on "Import".

After the CSV file is imported, please wait while our program crunches the numbers and compiles the top three teams.

Once we have come up with the most compatible teams that we could find, you the user will be able to tweak these results.
Just in case a student has requested particular team mates, or you know that certain students do not work well together.

After everything is said and done, You will be able to export a useful CSV file to help your students find their group.
