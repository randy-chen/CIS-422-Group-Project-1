Welcome to the Team Builder Project!

This is the GitHub repository for the first group project for CIS 422 Software Methodology taught by Dr. Michael Young.

Founded in 2017, Dijkstra's Dynamic Ducks is composed of several [contributors](https://github.com/tjlagrow/CIS-422-Group-Project-1/wiki/Contributors). 
At the moment, this program will allow you to sort a classroom of people into their best groups 
of around three people.  We are an inclusive, welcoming project, and encourage participation from 
people of all backgrounds and skill levels.

Given a .csv file with each student's name and available times throughout the week,
our program will give you the top three team configurations in beautiful React.

We do this by sorting through a proportionally relevant sub-set of the given student data.
As we sort through the times that your students are available, our algorithm selects the
top three configurations of all students. Each configuration is selected with team meetings
in mind. Our algorithm searches out and finds the classroom of teams that allows for the
most overlap. Giving your students the best chance to be the best team they can be!
